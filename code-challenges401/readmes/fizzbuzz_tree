FizzBuzz Tree, Fizz Buzz for Binary Trees!


## Challenge

This is a fizzbuzz implementation for binary trees.

## Approach & Efficiency

Approach

Traverse the tree in any order(pre, in, post) and change anything divisible by 3 to fizz, 5 to buzz, both to fizzbuzz.

Efficiency

FizzBuzzTree:\
FizzBuzzTree: T: O(n) S: O(1)\

## API
FizzBuzzTree:\
```public static BinaryTree fizzBuzzTree(BinaryTree binaryTree)``` Takes in a binary tree and returns a binary tree.\
```public static void fizzBuzzTree(BTNode node)``` Takes in a binary tree node and returns nothing.  This function does a post order traversal and uses fizzbuzz to alter the nodes contents.\
```public static Comparable fizzbuzz(Comparable value)``` This function takes in a value tests that it is an int and converts it to a fizz buzz format.\
